In testing the single-threaded versus the Fork/Join framework implementation for calculating directory size, 
the observed difference in execution times (0ms for single-threaded and 1ms for Fork/Join) is minimal and 
may not accurately reflect the benefits of parallelism for small-scale tasks. The Fork/Join framework introduces 
overhead due to task management and is more suited for larger, computationally intensive tasks that can be 
effectively divided into subtasks for parallel processing. The effectiveness of this framework is also dependent 
on system hardware, particularly benefiting from multiple processors or cores. For small directories or tasks 
that complete quickly, this overhead might negate the potential speed benefits. To truly gauge the Fork/Join 
framework's efficiency, it would be more appropriate to test with significantly larger directories, where the 
task's complexity could leverage the framework's parallel processing capabilities more effectively.
